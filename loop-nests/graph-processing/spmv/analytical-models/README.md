# Analytical models for spmv

This directory contains an analytical model for 2d-dst-src for the 
following configurations:

* untiled
* 1d tiling 
* square tiles (2d tiling on the original graph)
* hybrid tiles (1d tiling for hub vertices + 2d tiling for remaining vertices - requires a degree sorted graph)
