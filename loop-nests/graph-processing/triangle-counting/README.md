# Triangle Counting 

Naive implementation of triangle counting (counts each triangle 6 times). 

Potential optimizations include:
* Reordering the graph based on vertex degree
* Storing the neighbors of all vertices in sorted order.
* Implement TC assuming hw for set intersections

TC works on an undirected graph (<graphname-sym>.offsets and <graphname-sym>.destinations)
