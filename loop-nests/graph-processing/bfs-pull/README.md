# BFS-Pull 

This is a pull implementation of BFS. This is not a realistic implementation (pull is only 
applied for select iterations) but the implementation serves as a stepping stone to a push-pull
switching implementation that will be added later

The app works on CSC version of directed graphs (uses `<graphname>.in-offsets` and `<graphname>.sources` as inputs)
