This is a weight-stationary dense 6D convolution example.

This example implements 2D-tiling of input image over w (width) and h(height) dimensions.
Users can specify the size of tiles via command line argument "tile_size_h" and "tile_size_w." For easy use, the script "run.sh" also supports command line argumments.
The usage of the run.sh script is as follows: ./run.sh (Input/Weight_file_preset) (Trace level) (tile size in H dimension) (tile size in W dimension)
  * Currently available input/Weight file presets: A,B,C, or D
  * Trace level: 0,1,2,3 or 4
  * If you do not specify tile sizes, the default tile size is 4 x 4 (h x w).

Please note that edge conditions (when W/H tile size does not divide W/H dimension sizes) are handled in this example; you can put any size of tiles.
